# AgriAid ðŸŒ±

AgriAid is an Arduino-based agricultural monitoring and automation system designed to enhance agricultural practices through real-time data collection and analysis. The system consists of hardware components for environmental monitoring and software components for data processing and visualization. This system integrates sensors and automation to assist farmers in monitoring environmental conditions and optimizing irrigation and greenhouse management.

This project was developed during a 24-hour hardware hackathon by a dedicated team named "PRATIBIMBA" at the "KATHMANDU UNIVERSITY". The innovative team members are:
